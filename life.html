        <p>Lord Krishna's life is traditionally divided into various stages, each associated with a particular village or region in India, as detailed in Hindu scriptures. These stages reflect his different roles and divine acts. Here’s a brief summary of his life, divided by age and location:</p>

        <h2> Infancy (0-3 years): Gokul</h2>
         <p>Krishna was born in a prison in Mathura to Devaki and Vasudeva during a time of tyranny under King Kansa. To protect Krishna from Kansa, Vasudeva transported him to the village of Gokul, where he was raised by Yashoda and Nanda.</p>
        <p>In Gokul, many miraculous events occurred, such as:
        Putana's slaying: A demoness sent to poison baby Krishna was killed by him.
        Trinavarta's defeat: The whirlwind demon was defeated by the young Krishna.</p>

        <h2>Childhood (3-7 years): Vrindavan</h2>
         <p>As a playful child in Vrindavan, Krishna is renowned for his bal-leelas (childhood exploits), where he demonstrated his divinity:
        Stealing butter: He was loved for his mischievous acts like stealing butter from homes.
        Govardhan Hill: Krishna lifted Govardhan Hill on his little finger to protect the villagers from torrential rains sent by the angry god Indra.</p>
        <p>Kaliya Mardana: He subdued the serpent Kaliya who was poisoning the Yamuna River.
        His time in Vrindavan also saw him play the flute, enchanting the Gopis (cowherd girls), especially Radha, who is considered his eternal love.</p>


        <h2> Adolescence (8-16 years): Mathura</h2>
        <p> Around the age of 8, Krishna was called back to Mathura to fulfill his destiny of slaying his tyrannical uncle, Kansa, who had been trying to kill him since birth.</p>
        <p>Krishna and his brother Balarama killed Kansa and freed their parents from imprisonment.
        He became the prince of Mathura and continued to protect the people of Mathura from threats like Jarāsandha and other demons.</p>
        

        <h2>Youth and Adulthood (17-28 years): Dwarka</h2>
        <p> After constant attacks by Jarāsandha, Krishna decided to move his kingdom from Mathura to the newly built city of Dwarka (modern-day Gujarat). Dwarka became a prosperous city under his rule.
        Marriage: Krishna married Rukmini, followed by several other marriages to princesses whom he rescued, including Satyabhama and Jambavati.</p>
        <p>Kurukshetra War: During his later years, Krishna played a pivotal role in the Mahabharata, where he acted as the charioteer and guide to Arjuna. His teachings in the form of the Bhagavad Gita are one of the most significant spiritual texts in Hinduism.</p>


        <h2>Later Years and Departure (29+ years): Dwarka</h2> 
        <p>Krishna later life was spent in Dwarka, where he continued to rule and support the Pandavas. However, after the end of the Mahabharata and the destruction of the Yadava dynasty due to internal conflict, Krishna accepted the passing of his earthly existence.</p>
      </p>He was struck by a hunter arrow (mistakenly) and left his mortal body, returning to his divine abode.</p>
      <p> The Shreemad Bhagavata Purana primarily tells the story of Shree Krishna and his divine pastimes. It is one of the most revered texts in Hinduism and is part of the larger body of Puranic literature.</p>
      <p>The Shreemad Bhagavat Puran is a revered Hindu scripture that focuses on devotion (bhakti) and the divine pastimes of Lord Vishnu, especially Lord Krishna. Comprising twelve books, it narrates spiritual teachings, creation stories, and Krishna's leelas, emphasizing love, dharma, and the soul's union with the divine.</p>
